\title{Simple Random Sampling With Replacement}
\usage{
simpleRandomSamplingWithReplacement(i, n, m, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{The player i}

\item{n}{Indicates the cardinality of the set of players N (The number of players).}

\item{m}{The number of samples}

\item{v}{The characteristic function.}
}
\value{
The Banzhaf value of the specified player
}
\description{
Simple random sampling with replacement is a method to
  approximate the Banzhaf value for a specified TU game.
}
\details{
First, the algorithm takes a sample with replacement of all players
without the player i. Then the algorithm checks the value the player adds to
the sample. These two steps are repeated for the number of samples.

values in R software" (A. Saavedra-Nieves, 2020) Algorithm 1
