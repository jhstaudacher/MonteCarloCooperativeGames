# Guidance on algorithm selection

## Comparision between all different algorithms

// TODO: Table of all algorithms ans their features (Name, Source, is Efficient, for all players or only one, resulting Value (shapley, Owen, Banzef))

| Name                         | Source.       Description            | Efficent | Optimal | Result                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| ApproShapley                 | Castro 2009 | Simple random sampling |          |         | Shapley value for every player | 
| TwoStage St ApproShapley Eff | Castro 2017 | Stratified sampling.   | Yes      |         | Shapley value for every player |



## Speed comparisions

// TODO: Graph with all the algorithms compared with regards to speed, with different sample sizes.
