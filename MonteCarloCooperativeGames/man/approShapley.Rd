\title{Appro Shapley}
\usage{
approShapley(n, m, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Indicates the cardinality of the set of players N (The number of players).}

\item{m}{The number of samples}

\item{v}{The characteristic function.}
}
\value{
A list of Shapley values of every player
}
\description{
Approximates the Shapley value by using a simple Monte Carlo simulation.
}
\details{
Appro Shapley is a sampling method, which samples permutations of the players.
Based on: "Polynomial calculation of the Shapley value based on sampling" (Javier Castro Et al., 2008)
